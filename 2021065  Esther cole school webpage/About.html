        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        <p> We are alumnae of St. Joseph's Secondary School, Freetown, Sierra Leone, currently residing in various parts of the Southeastern United States. Our goal is to support our secondary school in Sierra Leone so that it will continue to maintain the
            status of being one of the best secondary schools in the country. The St. Joseph's Secondary School Alumni Association Southeastern Branch is a non-profit group formed in May 2006 by a few of its alumnae residing in the metro Atlanta area.
            Together, with our counterparts in Freetown, Maryland, Texas, California, and the United Kingdom, we established a global collaboration group. To date, we have awarded academic scholarships, renovated staff rooms, replaced classroom furniture,
            and engaged in various building renovation projects for our beloved school.

            and co-curricular programs.
